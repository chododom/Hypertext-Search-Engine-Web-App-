Department of Information Security 


The Department of Information Security is focused on cryptology, network and system security, design of secure hardware, and numerics. This department teaches the practical and theoretical basis of ICT security needed to solve the security aspects of software and hardware design. Students fathom the cryptological principles or methods of detecting attacks in computer networks within the courses taught by the department.
Research Activity
The research covers many areas of theoretical and practical security. The department is involved in projects within the Research Center for Informatics (RCI). Several modern laboratories are available for research.

Cryptology
Cryptanalysis of the cyphers, reverse engineering, analysis methods of side-channel attacks
Cryptography
Algorithms for cryptography, steganography, design of algorithms for special cryptographic hardware, accelerators
Network and system security
Detection of malware, reverse engineering, forensic analysis, ethical hacking, research methods for network attack detection
Design of secure hardware
Physical unclonable functions (PUF), true random number generators (TRNG), failure injection research, research of Trojan horse hardware, security vs. reliability
Numerics
Alternative arithmetics, numerical methods using special arithmetics, numerical mathematics

These areas are the research subject in several projects, groups, and laboratories. The department is currently involved in projects within the Embedded Security Programme. The following research groups and laboratories also come under the department:

Applied Numerics and Cryptology Research Group (ANC)
Ethical Hacking Laboratory (HackingLab)
RFID Laboratory
Forensic Analysis Laboratory

Educational Activity
The Department of Information Security covers the courses related to both software and hardware security or also numerics for all types of study programmes. For doctoral students, the department offers dissertation theses and supervisors. All the courses taught by the department are available in the White Book.
Bachelor Programme
Within the Bachelor Degree Study Programme Informatics, the department is significantly involved in teaching the Computer Security and Information Technology study branch. The department teaches the practical and theoretical basis of ICT security needed to solve the security aspects of software and hardware design.
In addition to the compulsory courses of the BIE-BIT branch, the department guarantees other courses, for example, Ethical Hacking (BI-EHA) elective course or Security (BIE-BEZ) course which is compulsory for every bachelor students.
Master Programme
Within the Master Degree Study Programme Informatics, the department guarantees the Computer Security study branch. This branch is focused on the research and development of secure information and communication systems. The aim of the branch is to acquaint students with cryptanalysis principles, detection, and prevention of attacks on computer networks.
In addition to the compulsory courses of the MIE-PB branch, the department guarantees other optional or elective courses:

Information Security (MIE-IBE)
Cybernality (MIE-KYB.16)
Security and Secure Programming (MI-BPR.16)
Risk Management in Informatics (MI-RRI)

Doctoral Programme
As the doctoral study programme is not divided into branches, it is possible to approach the supervisor with an idea of the topic of dissertation thesis related to some of the department activities. The list of all the dissertation topics is available on another page. The department also provides several doctoral courses:

Applied Numerical Mathematics (PI-ANM)
Quantum Information and Quantum Cryptography (PI-KIK)
Embeded Security (PI-ESC)

Contact
The Department of Information Security is located on the 11th floor, Building A—Thákurova 7, Prague 6. Prof. Róbert Lórencz is the head of this department, Ivana Holíková is the secretary. The list of all staff in the department is available either on the page with the list of employees or in the UserMap.
