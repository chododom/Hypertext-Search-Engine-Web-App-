We believe that NGOs' work is a critical asset for our society, protecting human rights and civil liberties. It is their critical work that makes them a highly valuable political target for a wide variety of powerful actors. The end result is a continuous flow of attacks and technical abuse. Usually struggling for financial support for their causes, how can they protect themselves? At the CTU University, we took a step forward to help them.The project has now its new website and social identity, offers 4 different free services to help NGOs and people at risk, and it's currently helping 8 organizations and more than 20 individuals across Europe, Africa, and Latin America.

The AI Village at DEFCON is a place where experts in AI and security (or both!) can come together to learn and discuss the use, and misuse, of artificial intelligence in traditional security. Artificial Learning techniques are rapidly being deployed in core security technologies like malware detection and network traffic analysis, but their use has also opened up a variety of new attack vectors against the systems that use them.

Česko čeká zkouška. Buď na vývoj technologií zareaguje, nebo ho nástup robotů porazí. Systémově zatím nemá moc nakročeno, i u nás ale vyrostli lidé, kteří na poli umělé inteligence patří mezi světové špičky. Jedním z nich je Michal Pěchouček z ČVUT, který prodal úspěšný start-up jedné z největších firem světa – Cisco. „V budoucnu bude hrát větší roli empatie. I vůči strojům a algoritmům. Budeme muset umět rozumět tomu, jak program uvažuje,“ myslí si Pěchouček.

Prof. Pěchouček pro HN: Umělá inteligence může z Česka udělat rozvojovou zemi
Odborník na umělou inteligenci z ČVUT Michal Pěchouček odmítá, že se umělá inteligence vymkne kontrole a zakročí proti lidstvu. Její rozvoj ale podle něj povede k novému přerozdělení bohatství na světě. Nově budou kvůli umělé inteligenci země bohaté a chudé na práci. Aby se na změny vyvolané chytrými algoritmy a automatizací Česko připravilo, mělo by podle něj reformovat vzdělávací systém.

AgentFly is an agent-based system for a large scale air traffic simulation. It is able to simulate tens of thousands airplanes in detail, e.g. to compute fuel consumption. It also models cognitive behavior of air traffic controllers to simulate their activities and workload. The AgentFly can be used to simulate complete air traffic over US to predict future air traffic

In Computation Game Theory we study and design new algorithms for finding optimal behavior in finite sequential scenarios, where agents have to deal with limited information, uncertainty, and competing opponents. Typical examples include classical card and board games, scenarios from the security domain, or auctions
