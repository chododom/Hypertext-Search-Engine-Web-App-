News


04.04.19 Thanks to Fulbright's Scholarship, Jiří Zemánek from Faculty of Electrical Engineering will study futuristic materials at MIT University


27.04.19 FELfest 2019 [June 12th]This year the festival of our faculty will be held on Wednesday, June 12th.


11.03.19 We have two awards in the Werner von Siemens PrizeOn Thursday 28 February, the results of the 21st edition of the prestigious Werner von Siemens Prize were announced at the Bethlehem Chapel. Among the winners were Ing. Jan Filip from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Ing. Libor Bukata of the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics.


05.03.19 Our experts have warned against the potential error of some GPS receiversThe so-called rollover, or the GPS Week number overflow, will occur on the night of 6 to 7 April. Experts compare this situation to the Y2K problem of the year 2000. The US Homeland Security Office, the Cyber Security Center, and even the ICAO have already issued warnings. Scientists at the Department of Radioelectronics at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, have already turned to the first Czech subjects with questions about testing and verification of their facilities. It is they who have experience with the development of the so-called Navigation, have developed several own GPS receivers, as well as the Russian GLONASS system, European Galileo and others. These people have been active in the Czech, European and international field of satellite and radio navigation for more than 40 years. And so thanks to its equipment and experience, several receivers have been tested for this situation and the public calmed down.



28.02.19 We are setting up a new research center on drive by wireA new Smart Driving Solutions research center has been created at the Department of Control Engineering. A team of 13 scientists led by Ing. Tomáš Haniš, Ph.D., aims to change the paradigm and to prepare the ground for the new technology of active dynamic driving, which has long been used in aviation industry. Experts from the department have been focusing on a long-term drive-by-wire concept, in which the driver does not control the wheels or car engine directly, but through an electronic control unit that has full control over the chassis. It is a technological revolution already underway by the aviation industry (so-called fly by wire systems are common in transport aircraft and fighters), but the automotive industry has not yet done so because of the conservative approach of the carmakers. Ing. Tomáš Haniš, Ph.D., is a researcher and developer who is coming to CTU with experience from Porsche Engineering Services and Rolls-Royce (aerospace division).


05.02.19 Interview with Chang-hee (Andy) Won, Ph.D.From February to July 2019, prof. Chang-hee Won of Temple University in Pennsylvania, USA will be visiting CTU as a holder of the Fulbright-CTU Distinguished Chair fellowship. His professional interests include sensors and image processing and advanced control theory.


04.02.19 Scientists from FEE will help research the union of Journalism and Artificial Intelligence

Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering prof. Ing. Pavel Ripka, CSc. and Vice President of the North China Electric Power University Prof. Wang Zengping have signed a Student Exchange Agreement.
