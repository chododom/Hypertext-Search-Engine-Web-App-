From today's featured article


Skipper Thomas Crisp (28 April 1876 – 15 August 1917) was a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross. A commercial fisherman operating from Lowestoft in Suffolk, England, Crisp joined the Royal Navy in 1915. He was killed in the North Sea defending his armed naval vessel, His Majesty's Smack Nelson, against an attack from a German submarine. The government used his self-sacrifice against long odds to bolster morale in the First World War during a difficult time for Britain, the summer and autumn of 1917, when the country was suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Passchendaele. His exploit was read aloud by David Lloyd George in the House of Commons and made headline news for nearly a week. After the war, a small display in his memory was set up in a Lowestoft library with parts of the sunken Nelson, which were dredged up years later, and a specially commissioned painting. This display was destroyed during the Second World War when the building was gutted in the Blitz. (Full article...)

Today's featured picture






The historical coat of arms of the U.S. state of Maryland from 1876. One of the original British Thirteen Colonies, Maryland was founded by George Calvert, a Catholic convert. It was named in honor of Henrietta Maria of France, wife of Charles I of England. It was admitted to the Union on April 28, 1788, after ratifying the new federal Constitution. Although one of the smallest American states, it has a variety of climates and topographical features that have earned it the moniker of "America in Miniature". Sixteen of Maryland's twenty-three counties and its largest city, Baltimore, border the tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay estuary.
